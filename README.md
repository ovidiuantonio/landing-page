# landing-page made by Ovidiu-Antonio
# Udacity project

In this project I build a dynamic web page. (HTML and CSS parts were from Udacity starter files + I added some new things)

The navbar is buid dinamically, when content it's added/removed from the page the navigation updates.

The section title is hightlited when in the viewport.

The navbar disappears after 2s when you stop scrolling and appears again when you start scrolling.
